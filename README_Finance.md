Project name: Finance Calculators

Project description:
This program would calculate the interest for "investment" or "bond" for the user.

When 'investment' is chosen, the user has to provide the amount of money, the interest 
rate, the number of years they plan to invest, and whether it is in “simple” or “compound” 
interest. The program will then calculate the total interest earned accordingly.

When ‘bond’ is chosen, the user is to input the present value of the house, the interest 
rate, and the number of months for the mortgage. The program will then calculate the amount
of money the user will have to repay each month.
