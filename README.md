# Sentiment Analysis

## Project description
This program uses the en_core_web_md spaCy model to analyse and classify a sample set of customer product review texts and makes sentiment predictions on them. The Amazon Product Reviews dataset is used in this project. Two most similar review texts with a reference base review text will also be shown to investigate whether similar texts have any effect on sentiment predictions. A report, sentiment_analysis_report.pdf, is compiled for this project.

## Installation concern
The program uses spaCy, spaCytextblob, pandas, random and matplotlib packages

## Remark
When running the program, please make sure that the dataset "amazon_product_reviews.csv" is in the same directory as the program file "sentiment_analysis.py"
